# PyTorch Practice

PyTorch: Empowering innovation in AI with intuitive and powerful tools for deep learning.

## Overview

This repository provides hands-on practice exercises and examples for **PyTorch**, covering a range of topics such
as `data preprocessing`, `data manipulation`, `linear algebra`, and more.

## Purpose

It aims to practice the basics of using **PyTorch** for machine learning and deep learning.

## Summary

Each section of this repository is dedicated to a specific aspect of PyTorch. The exercises are contained in Jupyter
notebooks, allowing for interactive learning and experimentation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```zsh
git clone git@github.com:IsmaelMousa/playing-with-torch.git
```

2. Navigate to the **playing-with-torch** directory:

```zsh
cd playing-with-torch
```

3. Setup virtual environment:

```zsh
python3 -m venv .venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

```zsh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

5. Install the required dependencies:

```zsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
